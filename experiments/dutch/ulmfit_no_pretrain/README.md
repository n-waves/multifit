# ULMFiT pre-trained LM experiment

## Description

This folder contains a Jupyter Notebook with experiments and results on the 110kDBRD dataset for sentiment polarity classification. It uses no pre-trained LM and the LM is therefore trained on all available data in 110kDBRD.

## Run

The `path` variable to the 110kDBRD dataset should be changed and the Jupyter Notebook should run fine.
